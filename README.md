# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

Fake news has become one of the biggest challenges in the digital era.  
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify news articles as Fake or Real.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning of text
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Jupyter Notebook for experiments + modular Python scripts for reusability

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
We used the Fake News Detection dataset (True.csv & Fake.csv)).

- Contains labeled news articles
- Labels: 1 = True, 0 = Fake

---

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook in notebooks/ or execute Python scripts in src/.

---

## Results
Logistic Regression: ~98% accuracy
DecisionTree : ~99% accuracy
GradientBoostingClassifier: ~99% accuracy
RandomForestClassifier: ~98% accuracy
